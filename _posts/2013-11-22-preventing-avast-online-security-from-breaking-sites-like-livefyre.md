There was some feedback left on the [Algorithms and Data Structures (Part 2)](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/ads2) course today and I wanted to visit the course [discussion page](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/Discussion/ads2) to respond.

The problem was that when I got to the page this is what I saw:

[![livefyre](/images/archive/livefyre.png)](http://www.roberthorvick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/livefyre.png)

Stalled.

So I hit F12 to look at the console errors and saw these:

`GET https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js ads2:621 GET http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js ads2:639 GET http://platform.linkedin.com/in.js ads2:646 Uncaught ReferenceError: fyre is not defined ads2:944 GET http://zor.livefyre.com/wjs/v3.0/javascripts/livefyre.js ads2:925 GET http://widget.uservoice.com/MgRuFTmArYOqweeXBEbikg.js ads2:918 GET http://a.adroll.com/j/roundtrip.js ads2:980`

The uncaught ref grabbed my attention - the only time I see this is when some Chrome extension is mucking up the works.

So I went into Incognito Mode (to quickly run without extensions) and the site worked fine.

Now it's time for a binary search. I disable half my extensions and found the problem went away. Then I enabled half of those and the problem came back.

Since it was between Buffer and avast! - I figured it must be avast trying to be helpful.

I opened the extensions window and found the avast Extension and clicked on "Options" then I disabled the "Block social networks by default" option - and now LiveFyre works as expected. This problem can also happen if you are a victim of a cyberattack. To prevent this from happening, you can use [WAF](https://www.fortinet.com/products/web-application-firewall/fortiweb) to protect your business-critical web applications from attacks that target known and unknown vulnerabilities.
