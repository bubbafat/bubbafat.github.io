This is my training plan to get from where I am to where I need to be. I have just over 28 weeks to get ready and I’m pretty confident that I can do it. So here’s my plan (and for reference – the first Sunday was yesterday, March 11, and I did the prescribed 4-mile run). The sporadic off-days in week 2 and 3 are due to some travel I have planned. Luckily my anniversary and several relevant children’s birthdays all fall on the scheduled off-days.

My goals were

1. Finish in under 2 hours. I know that’s not fast – but considering where I’m coming from it would be huge.
2. Build up to 10 miles slowly but steadily.
3. Continue up to 13 miles … this is more for my ego and confidence.
4. Taper down volume in the last 2 weeks.

The speed days are really more for me – I like doing them. I decided to work on my base for a while before adding them in but I might substitute one of the weekly 2-mile runs for some time on the track with my boys doing 400x10 intervals at my goal pace.

I would love any feedback on my plan – and if you’re running the 10-miler let me know!
