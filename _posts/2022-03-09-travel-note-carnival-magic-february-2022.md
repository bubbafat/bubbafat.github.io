This February, my wife and I took an 8-night Eastern Caribbean cruise. This was post peak-Omicron but still definitely in the middle of it. Since that's probably the part people have the most questions about I'll start with that information and then dig into the stats around the trip (and photos).

<h3>Covid Health Protocols</h3>

_As Carnival's health protocols are constantly evolving, you need to check their [Covid-19 Guest Protocols](https://www.carnival.com/legal/covid-19-legal-notices/covid-19-guest-protocols) page where they explain the current processes._

<h4>Booking</h4>

The only changes in the booking processes were that we had to sign more acknowledgements of the following:

- We understood the risks and uncertainties associated with cruising during covid.
- We understood the vaccination and testing requirements
- We were required to purchase "Vacation Protection" (trip insurnace)
	+ "Vacation Protection" was roughly 10% of the overall cruise cost (before port taxes and port fees).

<h4>Vaccination</h4>

It was required that everyone boarding be fully vaccinated using a [Carnival-approved vaccination](https://www.carnival.com/Legal/covid-19-legal-notices/return-to-service-faqs).  Boosters were not required.  There is an exception process cruisers could go through but what we were hearing on the cruise Facebook page was that they were scrutinizing the requests.

We had to fill out an attestation a month or two ahead of time acknowledging that we were vaccinated (or to begin the exception approval process) and they validated again during the boarding process.

<h4>Testing</h4>

Everyone boarding needed to have a negative test from an accepted vendor no more than 3 days before the cruise.  Since we were embarking on Saturday, my wife and I tested on Thursday (we were flying on Friday).

We used the at-home self-test rapid antigen from Abbot. See the section "Is self-test acceptable" on [this page](https://www.carnival.com/Legal/covid-19-legal-notices/return-to-service-faqs) for more information.

Our experience was that we did the following:

1. Ordered the tests from the Optum store (you have to use their branded/labeled tests).  It was roughly $150 for 6 tests - the minimum order size at the time.  I've heard you can buy 2-packs now.
2. We did NOT open the tests (they require to watch you open it on camera)
3. Installed the eMed applciation on our iPhones (this is where your record is stored)
4. Test day: we used our laptop to go to eMed.com and start the test process.  They walk you through everything - it took about 15 minutes per person and was very easy.
5. After about 15 minutes the results show up on your phone... except when they don't.  My wife's never did but they did email her a PDF that was acceptable.

Testing is also available at some ports the day of travel however you must make reservations ahead of time and there is a cost.

<h4>VeriFLY</h4>

Since we had our testing and vaccination paperwork completed we decided to try the new VeriFLY process Carnival accepts.  Basically you install the VeriFLY app and upload your proof of identity, vaccination, and negative test, and after validating it they provide you a clearance that you can show at the port.  Whole process only took a few minutes and they were liberal in what they would accept (photos, screenshots, etc).

_If you decide to try this, bring acceptable paper backups of everything._


<h4>Boarding</h4>

At the port you have a checkin time - don't try to come early but you can always come late (just not too late!).

When you arrive there will be two lines.  One is for people who have everything ready to go.  This line was pretty long and moved reasonably fast.  The other line was for people who either needed day-of testing, had vaccine exceptions, or simply did not have their paperwork.  That line was short but moving very slowly.

You will be crammed into a small room with a lot of people - if you have covid-crowd-anxiety, you might want a later time to get the masses get through.  We were there at 11:30AM and the line went out the door - probably a 30 minute wait in a crowd.

Once at the counter we needed to provide proof of our vaccination and testing results. Cell-service was non-existance in this metal cube building so even though I had VeriFLY open and ready, it was faster to just hand them our paper backups.

We did see people having their paperwork challenged and at least one couple was turned away because what they brought was not acceptable. They really did more than just glance - they compared IDs, checked dates, made sure things were from approved vendors, etc.

Once we were through the line we were able to get our boarding pass (not room keys) and were allowed to board. Once boarded you need to check in at your muster station and get a 30-second talk about how life jackets work.  It was so much better than a full muster drill.  It really just took a minute.

At 1:30 the rooms were opened for access. Your key will be in a tamper-proof sealed envelope at your door.  When you arrive you can ensure it has not been tampered with and then securely enter your room.  Luggage will show up in the next 2-5 hours (in the hallway outside your door).
