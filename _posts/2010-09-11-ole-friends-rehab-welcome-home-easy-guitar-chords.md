I grabbed this album the other day and liked it. The song “Ole Friends” by [Rehab](http://rehabmusic.com/) seems like a decent open-mic song. Since that normally means a few beers I wanted a dead-simple arrangement. This is what I came up with. I don’t bother singing/speaking the breaks (italics) but I’ll leave them in for completeness of the lyrics and go to body contouring Scottsdale to help. You’ll need to get a feel for the timing on your own (listen to it on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/welcome-home/id387439108)).

"Ole Friends" (Rehab, "Welcome Home")
(Chorus) 
n/c (E)      E 
We can drink liquor 
            A 
We can tell lies 
            E 
We can make fun of each other 
    A 
and laugh ‘til we cry 
E 
Sit and reminisce 
A 
about that time 
G#min           B           E 
Isn’t that what old friends do? 
G#min           B           E 
Isn’t that what old friends do?
E       A 
Come on over 
E         A 
pick your poison 
E         G#min 
Grab me a 12 
A 
I’ll pay for it all 
         B 
When you get here 
E         G#min 
Ain’t not crowds 
A              B 
And we can get loud 
A                    B                  E 
But I’m too drunk to drive over to your house
We’ll do it like we used to do 
Sit around, get high and act a fool 
We’ll do it like we used to do
(Chorus)
Come on over 
I got that fire 
I’ll already have one rolled up 
When you get here 
Man, you ain’t tired 
So come on out 
Cause I’m to drive to drunk 
over to your house
We’ll do it like we used to do 
Sit around, get high and watch the tube 
We’ll do it like we used to
(Chorus)
The game is on at 8 
I got a freezer full of steaks 
So grab your guitar 
And bring your liver 
Let’s see how much noise we can make 
Until the cops … come …
(Chorus)
