Back in 2012 I [trained for]({{ site.url }}/blog/disneys-twilight-zone-tower-of-terror-10-miler-training-plan/) (and ran) the [Disney Tower of Terror 10-miler](http://www.rundisney.com/tower-of-terror-10-miler/).

Well - I'm doing it again.

Ok ... So I've slacked on my running in the last year. In fact, I've slacked on many healthy things. So it's time to get back into it before I let bad habits replace good habits.

Since I have 32 weeks to prepare I am breaking it up into two distinct training periods. Weeks 1-12 will be a 10k training program (from Garmin).

Weeks 13-29 will be a half-marathon program (also from Garmin).

Along the way I plan to start hashing again (the [Carolina Larrikins](http://www.carolinalarrikins.com/) are a great group). Really bored? Want to feel better about yourself? You can follow my runs [here](http://connect.garmin.com/profile/bubbafat).
