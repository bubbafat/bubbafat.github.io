Every time I start creating a Twilio Web API application I always get a little frustrated. It's not that using their API is hard - it certainly isn't. Rather, their API does not play well with ASP.NET Web API.

Basically there are two problems:

- [TwilioController](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-csharp/blob/master/src/Twilio.Mvc/TwilioController.cs) does not inherit form ApiController
- [ValidateRequestAttribute](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-csharp/blob/master/src/Twilio.Mvc/ValidateRequestAttribute.cs) is not compatible with Web API

Neither of these are huge problems but they make using Web API more of a hassle than MVC - and then I end up either using MVC when I don't want to or I copy and paste code from previous workarounds.

But now I've had enough. So I set aside a couple hours and put together a proper (for me) Twilio Web Api assembly and nuget package.

Twilio's approach: [https://www.twilio.com/blog/2012/11/building-twilio-apps-using-asp-net-mvc-4-web-api.html](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2012/11/building-twilio-apps-using-asp-net-mvc-4-web-api.html)

## Twilio Web API sample code

Here's a Twilio Web API controller (deriving from our Web API TwilioController class) that uses the Web API ValidateRequest attribute to secure the API and performs a simple echo (using the TwilioController's TwiML method).

```csharp
public class SmsController : TwilioController
{
    [HttpPost]
    [ValidateRequest("YOUR AUTH KEY")]
    public IHttpActionResult Echo(SmsRequest request)
    {
        TwilioResponse response = new TwilioResponse();
        response.Sms(request.Body);
        return TwiML(response);
    }
}
```

Exactly what the MVC version looks like.
