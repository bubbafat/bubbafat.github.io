_Update: The definition has been updated to include support for atoms, variables and function names as well as additional file extensions. Screen shot and downloadable content have been updated._

Thus far I've done all of my Erlang development on Fedora using vim or KWrite (which does a decent job in Ruby mode).

But today I found myself on a windows box and wanted a basic syntax highlighting editor for Erlang that was free and worked on Windows. Oh - and not Eclipse+Erlide. I wanted something small and fast.

I grabbed the "[free as in beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_as_in_beer)" and "[free as in speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_as_in_beer#.22Free_as_in_beer.22_vs_.22Free_as_in_speech.22)" editor [NotePad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net) and created a simple syntax file that is a bit hokey but will serve my needs fine.

Here's a screen shot ... ![Windows Erlang Syntax Highlighting Editor](/images/archive/screenshot1.webp "Windows Erlang Syntax Highlighting Editor")

NotePad++ has pretty weak syntax highlighting but was sufficent to do most of what I wanted. Some regex based rules would make this a more robust.

Highlighted entities include

- Erlang reserved words (and named operators)
- Variables
- Atoms
- function names (same coloring as atoms)
- Operators
- Comments
- Kernal, stdlib, mnesia and odbc modules.
- Support for *.erl, *.hrl and *.htp extentions

I've probably missed several things.

Looks a lot better than nothing and it took all of 10 15 minutes.
