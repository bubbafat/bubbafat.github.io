I track my runs on Endomondo.com – today’s run is [here](http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/scUe-c0GP_U).

Started too fast and finished too slow – but overall not bad. On the plan.

I think tomorrow is going to be 8x400’s at the track with a focus on mid-foot strike rather than heel strike. I noticed when I did that today my speed bumped up about 50% but I was getting gassed within a 1-2 minutes. I need to build that up and improve my form. If I can do both at the same time … awesome. ![Smile](/images/archive/wlEmoticon-smile.webp)

Maybe I can convince one or both of my boys to come with.
