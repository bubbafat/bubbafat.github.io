I was having an issue where I would start Camtasia, the splash screen would come up and, about 90% of the time, the application would terminate. Sometimes it worked. Usually it didn't.

I started my search and found this support post at Techsmith: [https://support.techsmith.com/entries/22891787-Camtasia-Studio-Crashes-Right-After-Splash-Screen-Main-Window-Never-Opens](https://support.techsmith.com/entries/22891787-Camtasia-Studio-Crashes-Right-After-Splash-Screen-Main-Window-Never-Opens).

_It did not help._

So I looked for a log. I didn't see anything in the %programfiles%\\techsmith folder so I moved on to %temp% (which on my machine was C:\\Users\\Robert\\AppData\\Local\\Temp).

In the temp folder I found a file that had been created at the same time as the crash: G2MCodec.txt

I open it up, scroll to the bottom and find this gem:

    \[CamtasiaStudio\] ...
    First chance EXCEPTION\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION at 5D1FD578

Now I may just be a small town [country chicken](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQpaoLpKrMg) trying to make it in this crazy mixed up world, but I know a smoking gun when I see one.

Apparently GoToMeeting is injecting a little bit of suck into Camtasia.

Only one thing to do in a case like this.

Uninstall it. Plain and simple.

And now Camtasia works great, [every time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjvQFtlNQ-M).
