I know there are many variations in the Abbey Road LP – I’m trying to track down which I have.

What I know:

1. It’s a Apple SO-383 release
2. You can see sewer in the walkway
3. Her Majesty is not listed on the cover or album
4. The album label is thick lettering – I haven’t seen this much
5. The Apple logo is aligned properly
6. Matrix numbers are

1. s0-1-383-b19 #4 (maybe #1??)
2. sw2 383 a20 #1

Can anyone suggest where I can find more information about what variation I have and what it’s general value is (I’m not trying to sell it but I’m trying to get an inventory of what I have).
